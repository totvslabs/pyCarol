Welcome, this doc provides a tutorial on how to get quickly started on
the usage of Carol platform for Data Science, Machine Learning and
Analytics projects. The chapters of this document covers both the
theoretical part as well as an hands-on demo through a classic regression
example: Boston House Pricing.

This documentation is also available at github, at
`this <https://github.com/totvslabs/pyCarol/tree/master/tutorial>`__ link,
where it contains the source code for the examples we will be working
on. 

We start with an overview on carol components and how to find them on
the navigation user interface (chapter 1), next we explore how to load
your own data and build higher level data models over these records
(chapters 2 and 3).

On chapters 4 and 5 we explore the construction of batch apps on top of
Carol, explorying a very basic Jupyter based app to start, and then a
robust task management using Luigi.

The chapters 6 and 7 are dedicated to examplify how to publicate your
code as a service (API based on an online App) and with an additional
layer of basic UI.

We hope this tutorial brings you up to speed and help you build
powerfull tools on Carol!
