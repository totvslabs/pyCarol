# Online app: Building a simple GUI with Streamlit

On the previous chapter we've seen how to create an online app to respond to POST and GET requests, through a REST architecture and JSON communication pattern. On this chapter we will see how make a simple web interface to make the user interaction more pleasant. 

This online app is powered by the [streamlit](https://streamlit.io/) library, which is a framework for easily create web apps based on data. With Streamlit we will build a form interface that, once submited, the form data is packed, evaluated by the model and then the result (the house price prediction) is presented to the user.

## Online app api files structure

For this example we will use the files below. The `manifest.json` will follow the same configuration as the previous Online App, the `requirements.txt` will also be very similar, but with less dependencies and adding `streamlit` lib on it.

```
app.py
Dockerfile
manifest.json
requirements.txt
```

The `app.py` will be the Docker image entrypoint, it is where we create the web app using streamlit. The `Dockerfile` is close to the one generated for the Online API, the only difference is the `CMD` command, which now launches our App with the `streamlit run` command.

```
...
EXPOSE 5000
CMD streamlit run --server.port 5000 app.py
```

This forementioned structure covers much of the cases that you may need. Therefore, we usually only add our logic to `app.py`, and packages to `requirements.txt`. Keeping the `Dockerfile` as it is.

## Code: Streamlit basics

Streamlit provides a very simple way to create graphical interfaces: you just need to instantiate classes for the desired components and configure its parameters. Once the parameters are in place, every user interaction will triger the whole script to be reexecuted.

The code below simply adds a header to our web page and provides a brief description to the user.

```
# Add title on the page.
st.title("Boston House Prices")

# Add a text in our page.
st.write("Here, we can help you to find at what price it's recommended that you sell home.")
```

Next we add a form so that the user is able to fill all attributes for the house he wants to evaluate. Notice that first we create a form, then we add all the input fields and finally we add a submit button. A `form` is a particular component on streamlit that freezes the execution until the submit button is triggered, only then the code following will be executed.


```
# Creates a form and all the necessary fields to be completed by user.
form = st.form(key='my_form')

crim = form.number_input('Per capita crime rate by town', format='%f', min_value=0) 
zn = form.number_input('Proportion of residential land zoned for lots over 25,000 sq.ft.', format='%f', min_value=0.0)
indus = form.number_input('Proportion of non-retail business acres per town.', format='%f', min_value=0.0)
...
b = form.number_input('1000(Bk - 0.63)^2 where Bk is the proportion of blacks by town.', format='%f', min_value=0.0)
lstat = form.number_input(r'% lower status of the population', format='%f', min_value=0.0) 

submit_button = form.form_submit_button(label='Predict house price')
```

Finally, after submitted, the user receives the model prediction.

```
# When a user clicks on the submit button we predict and present in the screen the price of the house based on the information
# that they have inputed in the interface.
if submit_button:
    price = model_predict(crim, zn, indus, chas, nox, rm, age, dis, rad, tax, ptratio, b, lstat)
    st.write(f'Predicted selling price for home: ${price}')
```

## Deploying our app in Carol

To deploy your app follow the same steps described on the [previous chapter](../ch6_online_api/).
