# Machine learning on Carol (Tutorial)

Welcome, this doc provides a tutorial on how to get quickly started on the usage of Carol platform for Data Science, Machine Learning and Analytics projects. The chapters of this document covers both the theorical part as well as an hands-on demo through a classic regression example: Boston House Pricing.

The topics can be accessed throught the `chapters` folder or through the links below. Each chapter dir contains a `README.md` file covering all the concepts for that topic, and also all the files to build a functional app for the BHP example, when applicable.

We start with an overview on carol components and how to find them on the navigation user interface (chapter 1), next we explore how to load your own data and build higher level data models over these records (chapters 2 and 3).

On chapters 4 and 5 we explore the construction of batch apps on top of Carol, explorying a very basic Jupyter based app to start, and then a robust task management using Luigi.

The chapters 6 and 7 are dedicated to examplify how to publicate your code as a service (API based on an online App) and with an additional layer of basic UI.

We hope this tutorial brings you up to speed and help you build powerfull tools on Carol!
